# YAHTZEE-DICE-GAME
Yahtzee is a dice based game.
The code of this game integrates OOPS concept using Python.And Graphical User interface is used which tkinter and pygame.

Rules of the game:

• The game takes thirteen turns. Each turn consists of up to three separate
rolls of the dice.

• On the first roll you roll all five of the dice. After the first and second roll,
you can hold any subset of the five dice you want (including none of the
dice or all of the dice) and roll the rest trying to get a good combination.

• After the three rolls (or after the first or second roll if you choose to stop)
you must find a place among the thirteen boxes in the scorecard to put
your score. The score you get depends on the box that you choose and
the combination that you have rolled.

• After a box is used, you can’t use it again, so you have to choose wisely.
This means that, in general, you don’t have to choose the box that gives
you the highest score for the combination you have rolled, since it may be
advantageous to save that box for an even better roll later in the game.

• In fact, there are many situations it which it makes sense to put a 0 in a
”bad” box instead of a low score in another ”good” box because doing so
would block the good box for future turns.

• The Yahtzee scorecard contains two sections: the upper section and the
lower section.

• In the upper section, there are six boxes, each corresponding
to one of the six face values of the dice. For these boxes,
you enter the sum of the dice with the corresponding face
value (and ignore all other dice).

• In the lower section, you can score for various combinations
like 3 of a kind, 4 of a kind, Full House, small straight, large
straight, Chance, yahtzee and yahtzee bonus.

• At the end of the game, you get a bonus of 35 points if the
total number of points you scored in the upper section is 63
or higher. The seemingly random number 63 corresponds
to having scored a combination with three dice of the corresponding 
face value in each of the upper section boxes
(though any upper section total of 63 or greater
